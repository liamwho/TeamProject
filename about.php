						<p>At <strong>Hair Studio</strong> we are continually sourcing the newest technology in hair care products and the Kérastase Résistance Therapiste range is a breakthrough solution for damaged hair</.p>

<p>Described as “a second chance for your hair” it works by rebuilding the internal substance of hair weakened by chemical or mechanical aggressions to restore its strength and solidity. The range has been customised to deal with both fine and thick hair, leaving your tresses silky smooth with body and movement.</p>

<p>What’s makes this salon exclusive range so unique is the research into KAPs (Keratin Associated Proteins). These tiny proteins link keratins in our hair to each other and attach them together. When hair becomes damaged, these proteins disappear, which deconstructs the internal architecture of the hair fibre and leads to its gradual collapse. The Kérastase Résistance Therapiste range repairs and recreates the quality of hair from the inside out. Give your hair the second life it deserves!</p>

<p>The full range is stocked here at <strong>Hair Studio</strong> where our Kérastase advisors are always on hand to prescribe the correct products for your hair type. For further information visit the salon or call (074) 91 22000.</p>
